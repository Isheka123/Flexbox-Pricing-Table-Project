## Description

The HTML and CSS code within this project creates a responsive pricing table with three different pricing plans: Basic, Standard, and Premium. The flexbox layout ensures that the pricing plans align neatly in a row on wider screens and stack vertically on smaller screens. Each plan includes a title, price, and a list of features with clear visual indicators (checkmarks and crosses).

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the HTML and CSS files to your computer.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the Flexbox Pricing Table.

3. Explore the responsiveness by resizing the browser window to see how the layout adapts to different screen sizes.

## Customization
